<h1> Python Firewall Project</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project presents a Simple Python Firewall, a basic demonstration of network packet filtering using Python. Designed for educational purposes, it offers a fundamental understanding of how firewalls operate at a basic level, including packet inspection and applying filtering rules.</b> 





<b>Features:

Packet Capture: Utilizes Python's capabilities to intercept network packets.

Basic Filtering Rules: Implements rudimentary rules to filter packets based on IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols.

Custom Protocol Inspection: Demonstrates the ability to inspect different types of network protocols.

Console-Based Logging: Logs the action taken on each packet to the console for real-time monitoring.
